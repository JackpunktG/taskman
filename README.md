# Taskman

Since my last couple of programs, im trying to focus one alinging my programs more with the UNIX philosophy - doing one thing and doing it well!

Taskman is a simple task manager that allows you to add, remove, and view tasks and appointments from the command line. 
It stores the data in a simple SQlight database, making it easy to manage and query your tasks.

## Features
- Add tasks with a description and date
- Appiontments are added with time and date for easy searching
- Postpone tasks and appointments
- Marked tasks and appointments as completed
- Command to allow a check of appiontments comming up in the next 15mins -> perfect for a Crontab job

#### Still to come:
- Edit tasks and appointments
- More advanced querying options
